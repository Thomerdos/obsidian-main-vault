## Instructions

- [ ] Find the grains of the beef and cut against it. Do not cut the beef too thinly because thin meat will break easily during the cooking process. 
- [ ] Adding baking soda to meat is a common technique in Chinese cooking. It helps tenderize the beef. Depending on the weight of the meat, you will need to adjust the amount of baking soda. In this case, add baking soda, oyster sauce, light soy sauce, water, cornstarch, white pepper, sugar, and cooking wine.
- [ ] Add the beef to the marinade and massage to have the meat fully covered with the marinade. Set aside and let it sit for 30 mins.
- [ ] Now move onto the broccoli and cut it into bite-size pieces. Make sure to separate the large main stem for easier cooking. 
- [ ] In a small bowl, mix together the oyster sauce, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, water, cooking wine, sugar, cornstarch, and white pepper.
- [ ] In a medium pot, bring the water to a boil and add a splash of oil and a generous pinch of salt. This helps to keep the broccoli green during cooking.
- [ ] Add some cooking oil into the marinated beef and mix until all the meat is lightly coated in oil. This will seal in the juices of the meat.
- [ ] Add the remaining oil and stir-fry the sides. 
- [ ] Add the sauce to the stir fry and constantly mix for about 1 minute. Add sesame oil. Once everything is incorporated, add a little more leftover oil to coat the broccoli — it will make it look very appetizing.
- [ ] Taste to adjust the flavors and plate once it's to your taste! This is usually served at the center of the table and everyone can take the amount they want.
