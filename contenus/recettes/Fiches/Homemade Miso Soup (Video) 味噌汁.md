Make my authentic, homemade Japanese miso soup with an easy from-scratch dashi stock and classic ingredients like tofu and wakame seaweed.

## Ingrédients

- [ ] 4 cups water
- [ ] 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) ((⅓ oz, 10 g per piece; 4 x 4 inches or 10 x 10 cm))
- [ ] 1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) ((packed; I used a loosely packed 3 cups in the video for stronger flavor))
- [ ] 7 oz soft/silken tofu (kinugoshi dofu)
- [ ] 4 Tbsp miso ((use 1 Tbsp, 18 g for every 1 cup, 240 ml of dashi))
- [ ] 1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed
- [ ] 1  green onion/scallion

## Instructions

- [ ] Before we start... If you want to make miso soup in less than 10 minutes, follow my Easy Miso Soup recipe, using a dashi packet or powder.In this recipe, I make Awase Dashi from scratch with kombu and katsuobushi.For vegan/vegetarian, make the Kombu Dashi I showed below, or make Vegan Dashi with kombu and dried shiitake mushrooms.
- [ ] Gather all the ingredients.
- [ ] Cut 1 green onion/scallion into thin rounds.
