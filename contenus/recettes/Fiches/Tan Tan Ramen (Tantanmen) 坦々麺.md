Make Tan Tan Ramen (Tantanmen) at home—spicy, creamy, and bold with a savory topping. It's an easy, customizable ramen recipe with true restaurant-style taste.

## Ingrédients

- [ ] 2 Tbsp Japanese sesame paste (neri goma)
- [ ] 1 tsp miso
- [ ] 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- [ ] 1 tsp rice vinegar (unseasoned)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp la-yu (Japanese chili oil)
- [ ] 1 knob ginger ((1 inch, 2.5 cm))
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic
- [ ] 1 Tbsp neutral oil
- [ ] 6 oz ground pork ((use meat alternatives or chopped mushrooms for vegan/vegetarian))
- [ ] 1 Tbsp sake ((substitute it with Chinese rice wine or dry sherry))
- [ ] 1 Tbsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean paste)
- [ ] 2 tsp soy sauce ((use gluten-free soy sauce for GF))
- [ ] 1½ cups chicken stock/broth
- [ ] 1½ cups unsweetened soy milk ((plus more to make the broth creamier, as desired))
- [ ] Diamond Crystal kosher salt ((for seasoning the broth, to taste))
- [ ] 1 head Shanghai bok choy
- [ ] 2 servings fresh ramen noodles

## Instructions

- [ ] Gather all the ingredients. For substitution suggestions, please read the blog post. Prepare a big pot of water for cooking the bok choy and noodles. Slowly bring it to a boil on low heat while you prepare all the ingredients.
- [ ] A typical ramen bowl can hold 1200–1400 ml of liquid. We will prepare 1½ cups (360 ml) of soup broth per bowl, which should be more than enough for a ramen bowl size. If you‘re using bigger bowls, you may need to prepare extra soup to fill them up.
