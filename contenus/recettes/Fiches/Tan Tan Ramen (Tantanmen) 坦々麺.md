- [[1½ cups chicken stock/broth]]

## Instructions

- [ ] Gather all the ingredients. For substitution suggestions, please read the blog post. Prepare a big pot of water for cooking the bok choy and noodles. Slowly bring it to a boil on low heat while you prepare all the ingredients.
- [ ] A typical ramen bowl can hold 1200–1400 ml of liquid. We will prepare 1½ cups (360 ml) of soup broth per bowl, which should be more than enough for a ramen bowl size. If you‘re using bigger bowls, you may need to prepare extra soup to fill them up.
