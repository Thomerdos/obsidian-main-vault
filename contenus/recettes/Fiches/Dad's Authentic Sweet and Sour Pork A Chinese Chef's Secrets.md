## Ingrédients

- 10 oz pork shoulder butt
- 1 oz red poivron
- 1 oz yellow poivron
- 1 oz green poivron
- 1 oz red oignon
- 1 oz yellow oignon
- 4 oz pineapple
- huile de maïs
- 1 tsp ail sel
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- oeuf
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 3 tbsp fécule de maïs
- 4 tbsp ketchup
- 4 tbsp brown sucre
- 3 tbsp vinegar
- 1 tsp fécule de maïs
- sel
- 2 tbsp eau

## Instructions

- [ ] First, we'll cut to divide our pork into a few pieces, parallel to the grain. Then, we'll slice pieces perpendicular to the grain, into about 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces.
- [ ] These are all basically optional, but we'll cut our bell peppers (red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers, green bell peppers) and red onions, yellow onions into small triangles. 
- [ ] We'll make our sauce with ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, cornstarch, salt, and water. Mix it thoroughly for about 45 to 60 seconds.
- [ ] Add flour to the marinated pork and massage for about 1 to 2 minutes to coat the pork evenly in the flour. You may need to add dashes of water to help spread the flour around.
- [ ] As with our Honey Walnut Shrimp and General Tso's Chicken recipes, we'll be frying our pork twice, the first time to cook it and a second to bring out the crunchiness. 
- [ ] We're close to being done!
